# House_pc_codes
This repo is connected to the main coding folder of my home's desktop. Anything I do change there will be reflected here also unless I forget to push the changes that is :)
## The purpose of doing this was to:
1- Learn how github actually works <br>
2- To add up to my coding folder from anywhere and anytime I want <br>
3- Flex my codes lol XD <br>
